/*
Write an expression that calculates rectangle’s area and perimeter by given width and height.The width and height should be read from the console.

Input


The input will consist of 2 lines:
On the first line, you will receive a floating-point number that will represent the width of the rectangle.
On the second line, you will receive another floating-point number that will represent the height of the rectangle.
